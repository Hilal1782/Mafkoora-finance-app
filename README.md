# Mafkoora-finance-app
This repository has the source code of the finance management application that I made for Mafkoora Research and Development Center to easily maintain and keep track of their daily and monthly expenses. 

# Login-info
To login to the application, use the username 'Mafkoora' and password '123'. You can change this username and password according to your preferences in the database, you may also consider using a different login and signup mechanism for your security purposes. 

# TechStacks-used
I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and MySQL databases and PHP for the back-end.
